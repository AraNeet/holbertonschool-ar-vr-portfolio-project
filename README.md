An AR Rogue-Game 

## Description

This project is the final portfolio submission for my AR/VR Specialization. Phantom Rift is a mobile AR roguelike game developed in Unity, where players physically follow a procedurally generated character battling waves of enemies in real-world environments. The game was designed and built to demonstrate practical application of AR Foundation, procedural game design, and user-focused AR interaction.


## Two-Week Progress Evaluation
  ## Progress So Far
  Project Setup: Initialized the project repository and set up the development environment.
  Asset Integration: Documented required assets and prepared placeholders for integration.
  Core Systems: Began implementing player controls and basic game mechanics.
  Level System: Started work on the procedural level generation system.
  Major Blocker
  ## Procedural Level Generation:
  My main blocker has been creating a level system that generates a new, unique layout for each run. I encountered challenges with:

  Designing an algorithm that produces varied and playable levels.
  Ensuring that generated levels are both interesting and functional (e.g., all areas are accessible, no dead ends that trap the player).
  Integrating asset placement within the generated levels.
  ## Milestones
  Week 1: Project setup, asset documentation, and initial player controls. (Completed)
  Week 2: Prototype of the procedural level generation system. (In Progress)
  ### Upcoming:

  Finalize and test the level generation algorithm.
  Integrate enemy and item placement into generated levels.
  Begin work on UI and game progression systems.


  ### Staying on Track
  To stay on track with development, I plan to:

  Research and review procedural generation techniques (e.g., dungeon generation algorithms).
  Break down the level generation system into smaller, manageable tasks.
  Seek feedback from peers or mentors on my current approach.
  Allocate extra time this week to focus on resolving the level generation blocker.
  Work in Progress
  The current state of the project includes basic player movement and a partially implemented level generation script.
  Screenshots and code samples are available in the repository to demonstrate progress.

## Four-Week Progress EvaluationProgress Update

  ### Procedural Level Generation:
  After spending three and a half weeks attempting to implement a procedural level generator, I was unable to achieve a working solution. Despite researching various algorithms and making multiple attempts, I could not get the system to generate playable and   interesting levels consistently.



  ### Change of Approach:
  Due to the persistent challenges with procedural generation, I decided to pivot and use premade levels instead. This allows me to continue making progress on other core aspects of the project.



  ### New Focus Areas:
  With the level design approach changed, I shifted my focus to:


  Character State Machine: Started implementing the character state machine to handle different player actions and transitions.
  Enemy Implementation: Began work on basic enemy behaviors and integration into the premade levels.


## Reflection

  ### Blocker:
  The procedural generation system was a major blocker that significantly slowed my progress. After multiple attempts and seeking help, I made the decision to move forward with premade levels to ensure continued development.



## Milestones Achieved:


  Integrated premade levels into the project.
  Started the character state machine.
  Began implementing enemy logic.


## Next Steps
  Continue developing and refining the character state machine.
  Expand enemy behaviors and interactions.
  Playtest the premade levels and adjust for balance and fun.
  Integrate UI elements and polish core gameplay.
  Staying on Track
  By pivoting away from procedural generation, I am now able to make steady progress on the projectâ€™s core features.
  I will continue to break down tasks into manageable pieces and seek feedback as needed.
