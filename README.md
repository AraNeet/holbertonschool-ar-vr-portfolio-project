An AR Rogue-Game 

## Description

This project is the final portfolio submission for my AR/VR Specialization. Phantom Rift is a mobile AR roguelike game developed in Unity, where players physically follow a procedurally generated character battling waves of enemies in real-world environments. The game was designed and built to demonstrate practical application of AR Foundation, procedural game design, and user-focused AR interaction.
